# Shuttl Frontend Micro-task

This is a super small task intended to not eat into too much of your time, because we understand that you may have a job, family, responsibilities, or just like to play games in your free time.

_Playing games is important (along with the other stuff), and we don't want to eat too much into your time._

**What is this task?**
This is supposed to be some kind of a business card. As you can tell, it's **made pretty poorly**, and it's **intentionally broken**. This is intended (please don't judge us based on this card :P).

**You**, are supposed to make it better.
How? Completely up to you.
You are free to add or remove any bit of code you want. There's only two files anyway. The component file, and associated styles.

**I repeat**, you can change **anything** you want.
Make it look nice, and we'll tell you what we think about it.

Pardon our secrecy about what exactly this task is looking for. The main objective is to see how far you'll take it.
This task is intended to not take more than an hour of your time, but you're free to spend more than that if you wish as long as you return the task within the maximum allotted time (which should be a day usually, but could be more depending on when you got this task, and when your interview rounds are) so that you can find the hour you need in peace.
